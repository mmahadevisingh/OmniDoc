cost-effective and secure use of information and communication technologies in health sectors.Problems which appear to be small with unknown reasons, which may be risky to be ignored/ improperly treated can 
be resolved.E.g.- if one has a severe stomach ache at midnight in a remote village, instead of random remedies recommended by people around or Google, we can consult this app. The app would prove to be a boon to such patients living in remote areas and villages, as it brings the doctor's clinic on your fingertips. People of areas with no medical amenities can also avail cost-effective and quick consultation on a single tap.
